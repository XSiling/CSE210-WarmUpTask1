# Code Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the code, explains how to use it, and describes the purpose and usage of each function.

## Test Functions

### 1. `setTitle(summary, title)`

- **Description:** Sets the title attribute for a summary element. If a manual title is not set, it sets the title to the provided title value.

### 2. `isBlockLevelDetail(summary)`

- **Description:** Checks if the provided summary element is a block-level detail. Returns true if the element is an "a" (anchor) element, indicating a block-level detail.

### 3. `toggleSummary(evt)`

- **Description:** Toggles summary and detail classes for the provided summary element. It simulates the "Expand" and "Collapse" behavior. Requires an event object (`evt`) with a target property pointing to the summary element. Utilizes a timeout to ensure the transition effect takes place.

## Testing

The code includes test cases for each of the StretchText functions.

- `setTitle` tests whether the title attribute is correctly set.
- `isBlockLevelDetail` tests whether the function correctly identifies block-level details.
- `toggleSummary` tests the toggle functionality, ensuring that summary and detail classes are updated as expected.
